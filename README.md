# Assignment 1 - Plotting Collatz Sequences

This program creates three GNU plots of three separate sets of data. Each set
contains data derived from a collatz sequence with a given starting value that
this program provides. The three sets of data that this program generates
respectively contain the lengths of each collatz sequence produced, their
maximum value, the frequency of each length. The data created pertain to the
collatz sequences generated for every given starting value in the range 2 to
10,000.

## Building

Since this is a shell file, building the file is not required. 


## Running

```
$ ./plot.sh
```
